# Lab 1 - basic web target
This is my first cybersecurity lab project using **Ubuntu Server** and **Kali Linux**.  
I set up and configured **Apache**, **PHP**, and **MariaDB** to host **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** for learning and testing basic web security concepts.

## Project Summary
- Installed Apache, PHP, and MariaDB on Ubuntu  
- Configured DVWA database and user in MariaDB  
- Adjusted permissions and Apache configuration  
- Verified setup from Kali using ping, nmap, and curl  
- Documented the full process in the evidence/ folder  

## Evidence Folder
- ubuntu_setup_history.txt – full raw command history  
- ubuntu_rebuild_history.txt – filtered version with only key setup commands  
- dvwa_config_redacted.inc.php – configuration file (no sensitive data)  
- Additional .txt files – service checks, PHP version, curl output, etc.  

## Notes
This project represents my learning journey so I kept the original command history to show troubleshooting and progress.  
Future labs will focus on cleaner automation, documentation, and security hardening.
